This documentation shows the properties and methods of everything you will need to use. 
Many methods are for internal use only.

MAKE SURE TO READ THE README

Examples can be found in the examples folder
The images from those examples can be found in the images folder

Vector3:
'Holds x, y, z value. This is also used to represent r, g, b values'
	x: This is the x position or the red color
	y: This is the y position or the green color
	z: This is the z position or the blue color

Example usage: Vector3(0, 0, 0)

Sphere:
'A sphere is one of the objects'
	center: Vector3 that describes center of sphere
	radius: Number that describes radius of sphere
	color: Vector3 that holds rgb value of sphere
	ambient: Intensity of ambient lighting of sphere (Number)
	diffuse: Intensity of diffuse lighting of sphere (Number)
	specular: Intensity of specular lighting of sphere (Number)

Example usage: Sphere(Vector3(250, 250, 150), 120, Vector3(255, 255, 0), 0.5, 0.0001, 0.7)

Light:
'Used to help light our scene'
	position: A Vector3 that describes the position of the light
	color: A Vector3 that describes the color of the light

Example usage: Light(Vector3(250, 250, -200), Vector3(255, 255, 255))


Scene:
'Handles all rendering and raytracer'
	width: Integer that determines the width of the window
	height: Integer that determines the height of the window
	title: String that the determines the title of the window
	max_distance: Number that determines how far objects can be before being ignored
	camera: Vector3 that determins position of camera
	objects: List of objects in scene (see Sphere)
	lights: List of lights in scene (see Light)

Example usage:
objects = [Sphere(Vector3(250, 250, 150), 120, Vector3(255, 255, 0), 0.5, 0.0001, 0.7)]
lights = [Light(Vector3(250, 250, -200), Vector3(255, 255, 255))]
camera = Vector3(0, 0, 0)

scene = Scene(500, 500, "Demo", 1000, camera, objects, lights)
